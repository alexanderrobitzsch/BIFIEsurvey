Description:
    Contains tools for survey statistics (especially in educational
    assessment) for datasets with replication designs (jackknife, 
    bootstrap, replicate weights; see Kolenikov, 2010). 
    Descriptive statistics, linear and logistic regression, 
    path models for manifest variables with measurement error 
    correction and two-level hierarchical regressions for weighted 
    samples are included. Statistical inference can be conducted for 
    multiply imputed datasets and nested multiply imputed datasets.    
    This package is developed by BIFIE (Federal Institute for 
    Educational Research, Innovation and Development of the Austrian 
    School System; Salzburg, Austria).
